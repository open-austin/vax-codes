                This project aims to make it very easy for local communities to set up a system for
                community members to prove to event organizers and businesses that they have received
                a Covid-19 vaccine. Below are our how-to-use steps for both reciepients of the vaccine
                and organizers who want to check for proof of vaccination.

                Step 1: Request a QR code from an "issuer"
            </h5>
            <p class="ms-3">
                Have you been asked by an event organizer or business to show proof that you've been vaccinated?
                <br>
                If so, they may have linked you to this website and asked you contact a specific
                <a href="{{ '/issuers' | relative_url }}">"issuer"</a>
                or
                <a href="{{ '/groups' | relative_url }}">"group" of issuers</a>
                that they trust to verify you've been vaccinated.
                <br>
                Simply call, email, or visit the website of the issuer you want to get a QR code from,
                and they will verify that you have received you Covid-19 vaccine.
                <br>
                (NOTE: issuers may ask you for additional proof, like showing your vaccine record card)
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">
                Step 2: Get issued a vaccine verification QR code
            </h5>
            <p class="ms-3">
                Once the "issuer" has verified you've received a Covid-19 vaccine, they will generate a QR code and give
                it to you.
                <br>
                You'll get your QR code via email, text, or they may even print it out and hand it to you (if you're
                getting issued a QR code in-person).
                <br>
                You can save this QR code wherever you want and make as many copies of it as you like.
                <br>
                NOTE: Your QR code contains your name and possibly some other personal information (depending on the
                issuer).
                <a href="{{ '/scan' | relative_url }}">Scan</a> your QR code to see what it has in it.

            <h5 class="mt-4">
                Step 3: Show you QR code as proof of vaccination
            </h5>
            <p class="ms-3">
                Once you have your QR code, you can email, text, or show the QR code in-person to the event organizer or
                business that originally asked for it.
                <br>
                NOTE: It's up to the event organizer or business owner to decide which "issuers" they will trust, so
                check with them to see if your issuer is one they trust.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">
                Step 4: Event organizer or business scans your QR code
            </h5>
            <p class="ms-3">
                When you send or show your QR code to the event organizer or business that asked for proof, they must
                <a href="{{ '/scan' | relative_url }}">scan</a>
                it.
                <br>
                They will make sure they trust the issuer and make sure you are the person listed in the QR code
                (usually by checking your ID).

                Step 1: Find "issuers" you trust
            </h5>
            <p class="ms-3">
                Browse the
                <a href="{{ '/issuers' | relative_url }}">"issuer"</a>

                <a href="{{ '/groups' | relative_url }}">"group" of issuers</a>
                directories and see if there's anyone you trust to correctly issue QR codes to vaccinated people.
                <br>
                If you don't find anyone you trust, you can
                <a href="{{ '/admin/issuers' | relative_url }}">become your own issuer</a>
                and generate QR codes yourself to people you know have received a Covid-19 vaccine.

                Step 2: Ask people to get a vaccination verification QR code
            </h5>
            <p class="ms-3">
                If you have in-person gathering where everyone needs to be vaccinated,
                ask people to get a QR code from one of your trusted issuers or groups from Step 1.
                <br>
                You can link directly to the specific
                <a href="{{ '/issuers' | relative_url }}">issuer</a>
                or
                <a href="{{ '/groups' | relative_url }}">group</a>
                by clicking on that issuer or group's name and copying the url
                (e.g. "{{ site.root_url }}/issuers?id=some_id").
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">
                Step 3: Scan QR codes
            </h5>
            <p class="ms-3">
                Before your in-person gathering, attendees can email, text, or show you their vaccination verification
                QR codes.
                <br>
                Scan them using our
                <a href="{{ '/scan' | relative_url }}">scanner page</a>
                (should work on any mobile phone)
                or use any QR code scanner app and open the scanned link in a web browser.
                <br>
                If you don't have a camera, no worries! If you have an image file of the QR code, you can just
                <a href="{{ '/scan' | relative_url }}">upload it directly</a>
                on our scanner page (click "Upload an image...").
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">
                Step 4: Verify the scanned results
            </h5>
            <p class="ms-3">
                When you scan a QR code, it will show the contents included in the QR code and list the "issuer"
                and any "groups" that issuer is in.
                <br>
                <strong>VERIFY THE QR CODE CONTENTS MATCH THE PERSON'S ID</strong>
                <br>
                <strong>MAKE SURE THE ISSUER AND/OR GROUPS ARE ONES YOU TRUST</strong>
                <br>
                Anyone can become an issuer of QR codes,
                <em>so only trust the specific issuers and groups you picked out in Step 1.</em>
                <br>
                If you have any questions about the validity of a QR code, contact the issuer listed at the bottom of
                the
                scanned QR code.
