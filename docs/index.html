        What is Vax.Codes?
    </h2>
    <p class="text-center mt-4">
        Vax.Codes is a project to help communities start issuing QR codes to people who have received a Covid-19 vaccine.
        <br>
        Event organizers and businesses can then scan these QR codes to verify that a person has received a vaccine.
