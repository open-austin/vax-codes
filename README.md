# Vax.Codes - Free QR Codes for Covid-19 Vaccine Recipients

**WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS IN BETA**

Website: https://vax.codes/

This website allows event organizers and businesses to instantly verify that someone has received a Covid-19 vaccine by scanning a QR code issued to the vaccine recipient by a locally trusted organization.

The goal of this project is to make it easy for event organizers and businesses to re-open safely by incorporating vaccine verification into their admittance procedures.

## How it works

1. An "issuer" creates a QR code for a vaccinated person (can be emailed, printed, or texted)

2. The vaccinated person shows that QR code to the event organizer or business.

3. The event organizer or business scans the code, using any QR scanner app or https://vax.codes/scan

4. Scanning the QR code will open a URL with the person's name and verification they have received a Covid-19 vaccine.

5. The event organizer makes sure the "issuer" is someone they trust and checks name on the verification against the person's ID.

## Limitations

The QR code *only* verifies someone with that name as having received a Covid-19 vaccine, so QR codes can be interchangeable between people with the same name.

The issuer may optionally include other information (such as birth date) when issuing the QR code, to increase uniqueness, but that is up to the issuer.

This limitation was deemed acceptable to ensure the protection of other confidential medical information.

## Privacy

Vax.Codes does *not* have a record of people who have received the Covid-19 vaccine.

Our website simply keeps a list of registered issuers and groups and verifies a QR code was issued by one of those organizations.

Names are stored directly in the QR codes themselves, and QR codes are generated by issuers and given to vaccine recipients directly. So we never see them.

Also, the verification process happens entirely "client-side" (i.e. in your browser after you've loaded the URL), so our servers never see QR codes, even during verification.

Finally, this project is entirely open source, so security professionals can confirm that our website does exactly what is described and never gets any QR codes or personal information.

## Security

In the QR code, names are cryptographically signed by the "issuer". So modifying the QR code to change the name will not work.

QR codes are "signed" by issuers that can confirm that a person has received a Covid-19 vaccine. Each organization has one or more "signing keys" that they can use to issue new QR codes.

Anyone can register to become an issuer, so event organizers and businesses that scan QR codes should have a list issuers they personally know and trust and not accept QR codes issued from anyone else.

## Free and Open Source

This project was created by volunteers at [Open Austin](https://www.open-austin.org/), a brigade of [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/). The website code and project documentation are all free and open source.

The contact information for registered issuers and groups are the property of the organizations themselves, so you must obtain written consent from issuers and group owners themselves to include them in a re-hosted version of our website.

This project follows Open Austin's [Code of Conduct](https://www.open-austin.org/about/#code-of-conduct).
